	% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2024
	% package.

	% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
	% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
	% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
	% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

	% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
	% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
	% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
